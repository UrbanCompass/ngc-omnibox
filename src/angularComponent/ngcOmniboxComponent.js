/**
 * Omnibox Component
 *
 * The Omnibox Component is the main container for the Omnibox. It provides the following bindings:
 *
 * - `source({query, suggestions}) {Promise}` _(Required)_: An expression that populates the list of
 *       suggestions by returning a `Promise` that resolves to an array of suggestions. The
 *       individual suggestions can be of any type, but the list of suggestions must be an array. If
 *       you wish to provide nested suggestions (such as category headers, or a tree structure) then
 *       you must provide a key called `children` on your suggestion which will then be looped
 *       through to find more children, or the end of the list. It receives, in its scope, access to
 *       a string called `query` with the current query in the input field, and an array called
 *       `suggestions`, which is the current list of suggestions being displayed.
 * - `ngModel {Any}` _(Required)_: This is a one-way binding to the ngModel for the Omnibox. When
 *       the `multiple` option is set to `true`, then the `ngModel` should be an array. Each item in
 *       the array will be populated with choices from the objects passed via the `source` function.
 *       If the `multiple` option is `false` (default), then the `ngModel` will be set to the
 *       singular chosen suggestion.
 * - `ngDisabled() {Boolean}`: This expression should evaluate to a boolean that determines if the
 *       Omnibox component should be disabled.
 * - `multiple {Boolean}`: Whether to allow multiple choices from the list of suggestions. This
 *       option
 *     controls whether the `ngModel` will be an array (multiple is on) or a single choice (off).
 * - `hideOnBlur {Boolean}`: Whether the list of suggestions should automatically hide when the
 *       component itself loses focus. Hitting ESC will always close the list of suggestions.
 * - `isSelectable({suggestion}) {Boolean}`: An expression that should evaluate to a Boolean that
 *       determines if a suggestion is able to be interacted with. This expression will be executed
 *       whenever a suggestion is attempted to be highlighted either by the keyboard or mouse. It
 *       receives, in its scope, access to an object called `suggestion` which is the current \
 *       suggestion that is being interacted with. A non-selectable suggestion cannot be clicked on,
 *       hovered over, or interacted with via the keyboard.
 * - `canShowSuggestions({query}) {Boolean}`: An expression that should evaluate to a Boolean that
 *       determines whether or not the list of suggestions can be displayed. It receives, in its
 *       scope, access to a string called `query` which is the current query being searched on.
 * - `requireMatch {Boolean}`: An expression that should evaluate to a Boolean that determines if a
 *       matched suggestion is required for the field (defaults to `false`).
 *
 * The component has no template, all content that does not map to one of the sub-components will
 * be displayed in the final output as-is and un-modified.
 *
 * Sample usage:
 *     <ngc-omnibox
 *         source="myController.getSuggestions(query)"
 *         ng-model="myController.choices"
 *         multiple="true"
 *         isSelectable="!suggestion.children"
 *         canShowSuggestions="query.length >= 2">
 *     </ngc-omnibox>
